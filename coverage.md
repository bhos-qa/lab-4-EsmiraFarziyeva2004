# What is Statement Coverage?
Statement coverage, also known as line coverage, measures the percentage of code statements that testing has executed. Analyzing statement coverage helps developers answer the question, “Have all the lines of code been executed?” Developers can determine the thoroughness of their test cases and identify areas of the code that they have not tested.
# What is Branch Coverage? 
Branch coverage measures the percentage of decision points or branches that testers have executed during testing. Branch coverage helps answer the question, “Have testers tested all the possible paths through the code?” It provides insights into the thoroughness of testing by evaluating if all decision outcomes have been tested.
# What is Predicate Coverage? 
Condition coverage, also known as predicate coverage, is a testing technique that ensures every condition in a decision point, such as an if statement, is tested. It verifies that both true and false outcomes of each condition are evaluated during testing.
